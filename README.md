# React workshop

Based on: [https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-boilerplate](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-boilerplate)  

This workshop is intended for people with little experience in JavaScript and no experience in React. And which also speak norwegian..  

The entire presentation exists in `/presentation/index.js`. It's not pretty though

## Install

After downloading the boilerplate, your first order of business is to open a terminal and run 
```bash
yarn
```
or 
```bash
npm install
```
### Run
```bash
npm start
```

Open a browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running
```bash
npm run build
```
